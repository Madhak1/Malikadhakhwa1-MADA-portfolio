    "text": "I have re-created the chart titled “Share of members in Congress from each generation in Congress today”. This chart is a part of an article titled, ‘Congress Today Is Older Than it’s Even Been’ which was published on FiveThirtyEight website on April 3, 2023.

The dataset includes details of the congress members such as identification number, name, state, birthday, age in days, age in years, the generation the member belongs to, and total numbers of the Congress and the chambers attended by each member.\nThe preparation of the data involved setting the generation order and transforming the ‘start_date’ into a year format. With the help of Chat GPT, I was able to use mutate, group_by, and summarise functions in R to create year, and calculate counts and proportions of Congress members by generation and year. The ggplot2 package helped creation of the chart that replicated the original’s aesthetics. The data manipulation enabled the recreation of the stacked area chart with precision, although aligning the legend exactly as in the original chart proved to be a challenge. I managed to display the legends in two rows with slight differences from the original chart. The process was iterative. A key finding in this process was the importance of ordering the ‘generation’ categories from youngest to oldest to accurately replicate the original chart.\n\n# Set the order of generations from the youngest to the oldest\n\ngeneration_levels &lt;- c(\"Gen Z\", \"Millennial\", \"Gen X\", \"Boomers\", \"Silent\", \"Greatest\", \"Lost\", \"Missionary\", \"Progressive\", \"Gilded\")\n\n\n# Prepare the data for plotting\n  data_processed &lt;- data %&gt;%\n      #Convert 'start_date' to year\n    mutate(year = year(ymd(start_date)), \n     #Set generation in the order as described in generation_levels\n       generation = factor(generation, levels = generation_levels)) %&gt;% \n        #Group generation by year\n          group_by(year, generation) %&gt;%\n          #Count the number of members per generation and year       \n            summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %&gt;%\n              group_by(year) %&gt;%\n              #Calculate proportion of each generation per year           \n                mutate(total = sum(count), proportion = count / total) %&gt;%\n                  \n                #Ungroup the data frame for plotting              \n                  ungroup()\n   \n  \n# Convert 'generation' to uppercase\ndata_processed &lt;- data_processed %&gt;%\n  mutate(generation = toupper(as.character(generation)),\n         generation = factor(generation, levels = toupper(generation_levels)))\n\nGenerating the chart using the data and placing it with the original chart.The final chart almost replicates the original chart except for some minor differences such as the appearance of the horizontal grid lines and the legends.\n\n# Include the PNG image\nknitr::include_graphics(\"Graph_Original.png\")\n\n# Plot the data with ggplot2\nggplot(data_processed, aes(x = year, y = proportion, fill = generation, group = generation)) +\n  geom_area(position = 'stack', color='white') +\n  #Set breaks at intervals of 10 years\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1920, 2023, by = 10),\n                     #Set limits from 1920 to 2023\n                     limits = c(1920, 2023)) +        \n      #Scale the y-axis from 0% to 100% with intervals of 20%    \n        scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(), breaks = seq(0, 1, by = 0.2), limits = c(0, 1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"GILDED\" = \"gold3\",     # Applying the closest color to each generation\n                               \"PROGRESSIVE\" = \"pink\",\n                               \"MISSIONARY\" = \"violet\",\n                               \"LOST\" = \"gray50\",\n                               \"GREATEST\" = \"aquamarine\",\n                               \"SILENT\" = \"yellow2\",\n                               \"BOOMERS\" = \"orange\",\n                               \"GEN X\" = \"slateblue1\",\n                               \"MILLENNIAL\" = \"skyblue\",\n                               \"GEN Z\" = \"magenta\"),\n  name = \"\", # Remove the legend title\n  #Arranging the legend items in two rows and in reverse order of generation_level\n  guide = guide_legend(nrow = 2, reverse = TRUE)) + \n\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Share of members in Congress from each generation, 1919 to 2023\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"\") +\n  theme(panel.ontop = TRUE,\n        legend.position = \"top\", # Position the legend at the top\n        legend.box = \"horizontal\", #Layout the legend item horizontally\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 7), #Make legend text smaller\n        legend.key.size = unit(0.4, \"cm\"), #Make legend keys smaller\n        legend.spacing.x =  unit(0.4, \"cm\"), #Adjust spacing between legend items\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), # Remove vertical grid lines\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) # Remove minor vertical grid lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI leveraged the ‘DT’ package to construct an interactive table that mirrored the stacked area chart, adding a state column for a more granular analysis. This interactive table enables users to filter and explore the composition of Congress by generation, year, and state, offering a dynamic tool for engaging with the dataset.\n\n# Set the generations from the youngest to the oldest \n\ngeneration_levels &lt;- c(\"Gilded\", \"Progressive\",\"Missionary\",\"Lost\",\"Greatest\",\"Silent\",\"Boomers\",\"Gen X\",\"Millennial\",\"Gen Z\")\n\n#Creating a subset of the data including required columns fo the table\ndata_table &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(year = lubridate::year(lubridate::ymd(start_date)),\n                generation = factor(generation, levels = generation_levels)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::group_by(year, generation, state_abbrev) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %&gt;%\n  dplyr::group_by(year, state_abbrev) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(total = sum(count),\n                proportion = count / total) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::ungroup() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(Year=year, State = state_abbrev, Generation= generation, count, total, Proportion=proportion)\n\n\n# Prepare the data for the table\ndata_for_table &lt;- data_table %&gt;%\n  select(Year, State, Generation, Proportion) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Generation = factor(Generation, levels = generation_levels))\n  \n# Render the interactive table \ndatatable(\n  data_for_table,\n  filter = 'top', # Enable filtering options at the top of the table\n  options = list(\n    pageLength = 10, # Set the initial number of rows to display\n    autoWidth = TRUE, # Adjust column width automatically\n    searching = TRUE # Enable the search box\n  ),\n  rownames = FALSE # Hide row names\n) %&gt;% \n  formatPercentage('Proportion', 2) %&gt;% # Format 'Proportion' as percentage with 2 decimals\n  \n  formatStyle(\n    columns = c('Year','Generation', 'State'), # Specify which columns to style\n    `text-align` = 'center' # Align text to the left\n  )"

If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nWarning: package 'here' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/malik/Documents/1.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Either as comments in the script, or in a separate text file such as this readme file. Ideally of course in both locations.\nDepending on your specific project, you might want to have further folders/sub-folders."

Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"
