    "text": "I completed my PhD in Financial Planning, Housing, and Consumer Economics with a concentration in Consumer Economics from the University of Georgia this summer. My research interest is in the understanding of the impact of chronic illness on household dynamics. My dissertation explored the spillover effect of parental chronic illness on childrens’ academic achievements.\nWhile pursuing my Ph.D. degree, I discovered the opportunity to simultaneously engage in a second Master’s in Statistics while working towards my Ph.D. This flexible program, offered to passionate graduate students at UGA, allowed me to pursue statistical studies without impacting my primary doctoral degree. I am currently working on my thesis for the Master’s program, which focuses on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for Gamma mixture models.\nI have experience with SAS and R Studio, as well as some experience with Stata. I have statistical knowledge in linear, logistic, and fixed effect models.\nI would like to come out of this class with knowledge of Machine Learning Models and AI.\nOne fun fact about me is that I came back to school after nearly two decades, and I am enjoying every minute of it :)\nI have often wondered how much data have we, the humans, created? It was thus somehow eyeopening reading this blog 5 Interesting Facts about Data Analytics, which speculates on the amount of data we have created."

    "text": "This exercise explores the relationship of life expectancy with child mortality and population in African countries using the ‘gapminder’dataset found in R’s ’dslabs’ package. It is noteworthy that once the ‘dslabs’ package is installed and loaded, the dataset is available immediately for analysis. The analysis leverages the comprehensive capabilities of the ‘’tidyverse’ package for data manipulation, visualization and analysis.\nR’s help function provides insightful guidance on various datasets, including ‘gapminder’. For instance, executing ‘help(gapminder)’ in R prompts ‘??gapminder’, directing users to detailed information about this dataset.\n#load dslabs package\nlibrary(\"dslabs\")\n#look at help file for gapminder data\nhelp(gapminder)\n\nstarting httpd help server ... done\n\n#load tidyverse pacakge\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\nAs exhibited in the help window, the ‘gapminder’ dataset contains health and income outcomes across 184 countries from 1960 to 2016, details of outcomes listed below.\nThe str function pulls the structure of the actual data. As we can see below, the ‘gapminder’ data has 10545 observation and 9 variables. There are five numerical variables, infant_mortality, life_expectancy, fertility, population and gdp; three factor variables, country, continent and region and one. The year is stored as an integer data type.\n#get an overview of data structure\nstr(gapminder)\n\n'data.frame':   10545 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ year            : int  1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  115.4 148.2 208 NA 59.9 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  62.9 47.5 36 63 65.4 ...\n $ fertility       : num  6.19 7.65 7.32 4.43 3.11 4.55 4.82 3.45 2.7 5.57 ...\n $ population      : num  1636054 11124892 5270844 54681 20619075 ...\n $ gdp             : num  NA 1.38e+10 NA NA 1.08e+11 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 4 1 1 2 2 3 2 5 4 3 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 19 11 10 2 15 21 2 1 22 21 ...\nThe summary(gapminder) provides statistical overview. For numerical columns, it presents minimum, maximum, mean, median, quartiles and missing values. For categorical or factor columns, it provides a count of the number of occurrences of each level. For example, there are 2907 observations related to the continent of Africa, 2052 related to Americas, 2679 related to Asia, 2223 related to Europe and 684 related to Ocenia.\n#get a summary of data\nsummary(gapminder)\n\n                country           year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Albania            :   57   Min.   :1960   Min.   :  1.50   Min.   :13.20  \n Algeria            :   57   1st Qu.:1974   1st Qu.: 16.00   1st Qu.:57.50  \n Angola             :   57   Median :1988   Median : 41.50   Median :67.54  \n Antigua and Barbuda:   57   Mean   :1988   Mean   : 55.31   Mean   :64.81  \n Argentina          :   57   3rd Qu.:2002   3rd Qu.: 85.10   3rd Qu.:73.00  \n Armenia            :   57   Max.   :2016   Max.   :276.90   Max.   :83.90  \n (Other)            :10203                  NA's   :1453                    \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent   \n Min.   :0.840   Min.   :3.124e+04   Min.   :4.040e+07   Africa  :2907  \n 1st Qu.:2.200   1st Qu.:1.333e+06   1st Qu.:1.846e+09   Americas:2052  \n Median :3.750   Median :5.009e+06   Median :7.794e+09   Asia    :2679  \n Mean   :4.084   Mean   :2.701e+07   Mean   :1.480e+11   Europe  :2223  \n 3rd Qu.:6.000   3rd Qu.:1.523e+07   3rd Qu.:5.540e+10   Oceania : 684  \n Max.   :9.220   Max.   :1.376e+09   Max.   :1.174e+13                  \n NA's   :187     NA's   :185         NA's   :2972                       \n             region    \n Western Asia   :1026  \n Eastern Africa : 912  \n Western Africa : 912  \n Caribbean      : 741  \n South America  : 684  \n Southern Europe: 684  \n (Other)        :5586\nIt is important to find out the class or type of an object in R before applying any functions and operations. Determining the object’s class with ‘class(gapminder)’ confirms that ‘gapminder’ is a ‘data.frame’, indicative of its tabular structure in R.\n#determine the type of object gapminder is\nclass(gapminder)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\nIn the next step of analysis, a subset named ‘africadata’ is created, containing only observations related to African countries.\n#Assigning only the African countries to a new object/variable called africadata\nafricadata &lt;- gapminder[gapminder$continent == \"Africa\", ]\nExamining ‘africadata’ with str(africadata) shows a reduction to 2907 observations. However, summary(africadata) still includes other continent categories, with zero counts. This peculiarity arises because R retains factor levels in subsets even when no observations exist for certain categories.\n#Running str for africadata\nstr(africadata)\n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 2 3 18 22 26 27 29 31 32 33 ...\n $ year            : int  1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  148 208 187 116 161 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n $ fertility       : num  7.65 7.32 6.28 6.62 6.29 6.95 5.65 6.89 5.84 6.25 ...\n $ population      : num  11124892 5270844 2431620 524029 4829291 ...\n $ gdp             : num  1.38e+10 NA 6.22e+08 1.24e+08 5.97e+08 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 11 10 20 17 20 5 10 20 10 10 ...\n#Summary of africadata\nsummary(africadata)\n\n         country          year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Algeria     :  57   Min.   :1960   Min.   : 11.40   Min.   :13.20  \n Angola      :  57   1st Qu.:1974   1st Qu.: 62.20   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Benin       :  57   Median :1988   Median : 93.40   Median :53.98  \n Botswana    :  57   Mean   :1988   Mean   : 95.12   Mean   :54.38  \n Burkina Faso:  57   3rd Qu.:2002   3rd Qu.:124.70   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Burundi     :  57   Max.   :2016   Max.   :237.40   Max.   :77.60  \n (Other)     :2565                  NA's   :226                     \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent   \n Min.   :1.500   Min.   :    41538   Min.   :4.659e+07   Africa  :2907  \n 1st Qu.:5.160   1st Qu.:  1605232   1st Qu.:8.373e+08   Americas:   0  \n Median :6.160   Median :  5570982   Median :2.448e+09   Asia    :   0  \n Mean   :5.851   Mean   : 12235961   Mean   :9.346e+09   Europe  :   0  \n 3rd Qu.:6.860   3rd Qu.: 13888152   3rd Qu.:6.552e+09   Oceania :   0  \n Max.   :8.450   Max.   :182201962   Max.   :1.935e+11                  \n NA's   :51      NA's   :51          NA's   :637                        \n                       region   \n Eastern Africa           :912  \n Western Africa           :912  \n Middle Africa            :456  \n Northern Africa          :342  \n Southern Africa          :285  \n Australia and New Zealand:  0  \n (Other)                  :  0\nFurther analysis involves creating two subsets from ‘africadata’: ‘africa_infant_life’ with ‘infant_mortality’ and ‘life_expectancy’, and ‘africa_pop_life’ with ‘population’ and ‘life_expectancy’.\n#Creating africa_infant_life which is a subset of africadata containing only 'infant_mortality' and 'life_expectancy'\n\nafrica_infant_life &lt;- africadata[,c(\"infant_mortality\", \"life_expectancy\")]\nThe structures and summaries reveal africa_infant_life has two columns, 2907 observations, and 226 missing values in infant_mortality.\n#Running str for africa_infant_life\nstr(africa_infant_life)\n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ infant_mortality: num  148 208 187 116 161 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n#Summary of africa_infant_life\nsummary(africa_infant_life)\n\n infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Min.   : 11.40   Min.   :13.20  \n 1st Qu.: 62.20   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Median : 93.40   Median :53.98  \n Mean   : 95.12   Mean   :54.38  \n 3rd Qu.:124.70   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Max.   :237.40   Max.   :77.60  \n NA's   :226\n#Creating africa_pop_life which is a subset of africadata containing only population and life_expectancy\n\nafrica_pop_life &lt;- africadata[,c(\"population\", \"life_expectancy\")]\nLikewise, the str function of africa_pop_life showed that this object also has 2907 observations and two columns.

Whichever approach you choose, add ample documentation/commentary so you and others can easily understand what’s going on and what is done."

Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

The following space has the packages I used.\n\nlibrary(dslabs)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nThen, I used the str() function to explore the structure of the dataframe and summary() to check the summary for each one of the variables of this dataframe.\n\n#Explore the 'greenhouse_gases' dataframe using the 'str()' and 'summary()' functions\nstr(greenhouse_gases)\n\n'data.frame':   300 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ year         : num  20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 ...\n $ gas          : chr  \"CO2\" \"CO2\" \"CO2\" \"CO2\" ...\n $ concentration: num  278 278 277 277 278 ...\n\nsummary(greenhouse_gases)\n\n      year          gas            concentration   \n Min.   :  20   Length:300         Min.   : 260.0  \n 1st Qu.: 515   Class :character   1st Qu.: 269.7  \n Median :1010   Mode  :character   Median : 279.7  \n Mean   :1010                      Mean   : 416.2  \n 3rd Qu.:1505                      3rd Qu.: 641.0  \n Max.   :2000                      Max.   :1703.4  \n\n\nThis dataset consists of 300 observations by 3 variables: The years go from 1 to 2000 (CE) in 20 years intervals in the variable year. The gas variable lists three gases: CO2, CH4 and N2O, and the variable concentration describes the gas concentration in ppm (CO2) or ppb (CH4, N2O).\nIn this case, I was just interested in the concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide, so I created a new object gases that includes only the CH4 and N2O observations.\n\n#Used the `filter()` function to select only the observations needed from the variable `gas`. To do this I used the | operator which means \"OR\". In this case filtering for CH4 OR N2O\ngases &lt;- greenhouse_gases %&gt;% filter(gas == \"CH4\" | gas == \"N2O\")\n\nI decided to rename the values of ‘CH4’ to ‘Methane’ and ‘N2O’ to ‘Nitrous Oxide’ using the mutate() and recode() functions. And then used str() to check if the changes were applied to the dataframe.\n\n#Here I am keeping the variable `gas` the same, but renaming CH4 to \"Methane\" and N2O to \"Nitrous Oxide\" using the `recode()` function.\ngases &lt;- gases %&gt;% mutate(gas = recode(gas, \"CH4\" = \"Methane\",\n                              \"N2O\" = \"Nitrous Oxide\"))\n\n#And now using `str()` to check if the changes to this dataframe have been applied\nstr(gases)\n\n'data.frame':   200 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ year         : num  20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 ...\n $ gas          : chr  \"Methane\" \"Methane\" \"Methane\" \"Methane\" ...\n $ concentration: num  638 631 628 628 631 ...\n\n\nFirst, I just wanted to explore what were the concentrations observed for both gases, to see if there is a chance they remained constant through time. To do this I used ggplot() and set to a histogram with geom_histogram()\n\nggplot(gases, aes(x= concentration, fill= gas))+ #Here I selected the dataset `gases`, then I set `concentration` to the x-axis and sepparated by type of gas using different colors using `fill=gas`\n  geom_histogram()+ #Set the geometry to histogram\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1800, 250))+ #Added more labels to the x-axis\n  labs(x= \"Concentration (ppb)\", y= \"Count\") #Changed the x and y-axis titles\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the previous plot, it is observed that most of the concentrations from Nitrous oxide are around 230 and 310 ppb, and for Methane most of them are between 600 and 750 ppb, but there are a few high concentrations. So, I decided to explore the trends from both gases through time, maybe the highest concentrations for Methane are from recent years. I created a plot that shows both gases using the ggplot() package using the geom_point() geometry.\n\nggplot(gases, aes(x= year, y= concentration, color= gas))+ #Here I selected the `gases` dataset, then plotted `year` in the x-axis and `concentration` in the y-axis. I used `color= gas`, so both gases are separated in the same graph\n  geom_point()+ #Used the point geometry\n  labs(x= \"Year\", y= \"Concentration (ppb)\")+ #Changed the x and y-axis labels\n  theme_classic() #I decided to use a different theme for this plot, to make it more visually appealing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the graph, it is observed that the concentration of both gases remain almost constant. However, around the year 1700, the concentration of methane started to increase and has remained high until the year 2000. For nitrous oxide, the concentration is also observed to increase around the year 1800.\nIt seems that the increase is related to the same historical event, which could be the industrialization that began around the 18th century. To explore if both gases are related and try to find a causal explanation I decided to do a simple correlation test, using the cor() function. But first I created the new objects CH4 and N2O to perform the test.\n\n#First I separated both gases into separate objects using the `filter()` function then I pulled only the `concentration` variable using the `pull()` function. I asssigned them to their respective objects.\nCH4 &lt;- gases %&gt;% filter(gas == \"Methane\") %&gt;% pull(concentration)\nN2O &lt;- gases %&gt;% filter(gas == \"Nitrous Oxide\") %&gt;% pull(concentration)\n\n#Then I checked if the new objects were correctly saved using the `summary()` function.\nsummary(CH4)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  618.7   641.3   661.5   697.9   686.0  1703.4 \n\nsummary(N2O)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  260.0   264.5   267.4   268.5   269.7   315.4 \n\n\nAnd now perform the correlation test using the ‘Pearson’ method from the cor() function\n\ncor(CH4, N2O, method = \"pearson\")\n\n[1] 0.9391766\n\n\nIt is observed that both gases are highly correlated (r= 0.939), so this could mean that the increase in the concentration in the last two to three centuries could be due to the same reason. Industrialization could be the main cause for this, but other statistical analysis and more environmental parameters can aid to infer the causality."
