I completed my PhD in Financial Planning, Housing, and Consumer Economics with a concentration in Consumer Economics from the University of Georgia this summer. My research interest is in the understanding of the impact of chronic illness on household dynamics. My dissertation explored the spillover effect of parental chronic illness on childrens' academic achievements.

While pursuing my Ph.D. degree, I discovered the opportunity to simultaneously engage in a second Master's in Statistics while working towards my Ph.D. This flexible program, offered to passionate graduate students at UGA, allowed me to pursue statistical studies without impacting my primary doctoral degree. I am currently working on my thesis for the Master's program, which focuses on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for Gamma mixture models.

I have experience with SAS and R Studio, as well as some experience with Stata. I have statistical knowledge in linear, logistic, and fixed effect models.

I would like to come out of this class with knowledge of Machine Learning Models and AI.

One fun fact about me is that I came back to school after nearly two decades, and I am enjoying every minute of it :)

I have often wondered how much data have we, the humans, created? It was thus somehow eyeopening reading this blog [***5 Interesting Facts about Data Analytics***](https://blueoceanlab.io/blog/10/5-interesting-facts-about-data-analytics)***,*** which speculates on the amount of data we have created.
