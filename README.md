# My website and data analysis portfolio 
This repository contains projects from the Modern Applied Data Analysis (MADA) course. Throughout the course, the focus was on defining meaningful data analysis questions and assessing the feasibility of answering them with available data. I gained experience in obtaining, organizing, and processing data for detailed analysis and learned to select appropriate analysis methods for each project. The coursework emphasized efficient communication of analysis results to various stakeholders and the use of modern coding and analysis tools to implement automated, reproducible analysis and project management workflows. Additionally, the course fostered the development of skills to critically assess both my own analyses and those of others with an emphasis on collaboration. As the semester progressed, my work became more refined, with the later projects reflecting a higher level of sophistication and skill.
