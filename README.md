# My website and data analysis portfolio 
This repository contains assignments from the Modern Applied Data Analysis (MADA) course, an applied, hands-on class focused on modern data analysis techniques. The course covered topics such as regression, tree-based models, cross-validation, bootstrapping, model selection, and Machine Learning approaches. Emphasis was placed on defining meaningful data analysis questions and assessing the feasibility of answering them with available data.

Throughout the course, I gained practical experience in obtaining, organizing, and processing data for detailed analysis, and learned to select appropriate analytical methods for each project. The coursework also stressed the importance of effectively communicating analysis results to various stakeholders and utilizing modern coding and analysis tools to implement automated, reproducible workflows.

Additionally, the course fostered critical assessment skills for both my own analyses and those of others, with a strong emphasis on collaboration. As the semester progressed, my work became more refined, with the later projects (such as fitting-exercise and ml-models-exercise) reflecting a higher level of sophistication and skill.
